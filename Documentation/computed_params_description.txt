The parameters in computed_params.json are computed by a compiled Matlab script (compute_DCS_params_GPU)
called by the C application upon receiving the proper sequence of TCP commands for pre-acquistion and compute parameters.

They are returned via TCP to the python interface, mostly for display and info to the user
Most of these parameters should not be modified by the user and currently no modification is actually supported

In the future, changing the signs (conjugates) will be supported.

  "conjugateCW1_C1": 		1,				Signs for the phase combinations are impplemented by conjugating exp(j*phi)				
  "conjugateCW1_C2": 		0,				First two are for each comb / CW beatnotes
  "conjugateCW2_C1": 		0,				Last two are for CEO beatnotes (2 CWs referencing coming in the future)
  "conjugateCW2_C2": 		1,
  "conjugateDfr1": 		0,				These are for the computation of N*dfr								
  "conjugateDfr2": 		1,				(see algo flow chart)

  "slope_self_correction": 	0,				Factor to bring the center of mass near 0 Hz when no phase projection is used
  "projection_factor": 		-0.021565511088480711,		Factor to bring the projection wavelength asked by the user to 0 Hz
  "references_offset_pts": 	0,				Number of points offset between the references and the IGMs (1 value for all references for now)
  	
Used internally in the C++ application during the real-time acquisition or post-processing
