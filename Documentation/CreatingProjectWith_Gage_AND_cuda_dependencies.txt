Install Microsoft Visual 
Install CUDA	(needs to be installed AFTER visual)
Install GaGe cardsoftware

create project

Enable CUDA extensions in project 
	right click on project name ... build dependencies ... Build Customizations...
	Select the proper CUDA extension according to latest install

Add Compuscope to header search path
	$(GageDir)\include
	$(GageDir)\CompuScope C SDK\C Common

	or  (if The CompuScpope SDK is copied in the project root)
	..\CompuScope\include
	..\CompuScope\CompuScope C SDK\C Common

	to project header search path 
		(in project properties ... C++ additionnal include header directories)

	 The first is such that the compuscope (CsSsm.lib) library functions prototype are defined
	 The second appear to be needed for CsAppSupport.lib, but it is strange that headers are not in <include> folder

Add Compusope to library search path
	$(GageDir)\lib64  OR  ..\CompuScope\lib64

	in properties .. linker .. general .. additonnal libray directories

Actually add libraries to the project
	CsAppSupport.lib
	CsSsm.lib 

	in project properties .. linker .. input .. additionnal dependencies

Finally, for -some reason- the functions of CsSdkMisc.c  are not in the library, so this one needs to be added to the project
these are only functions to display messages.
