The apriori_params.json in the "parameters" folder of the python interface code when the interface is started.
You can edit and save it using the 'A Priori Parameters' panel in the python interface. 

These parameters describe your setup and experiment. They provide guidance to the processing code as how to compute de correction parameters
(see Computed parameters).

This file describes the meaning of each parameter expected in this "apriori_params.json" file
as well as the default values used as of March 2024, with a NIST NIR open path system card

The lower you go in the list, the more you should question if you should really modify this parameter

Typical values are given as examples

    "do_phase_projection": 			1,				0: do the fast phase correction at the optical reference WL, 1: Do fast phase correction at projected WL (only avail with 2 refs)
    "projection_wvl_nm": 			1645,				WL at which the phase noise is computed from the two references and that will be perfectly corrected by fast phase correction 
    "do_fast_resampling" :			0,				Wether or not the fast resampling step is performed. 
    "spectro_mode" :				0,				0: Normal 1: DFG  (future use 2: Frequency doubling, ...) 

    "references_total_path_length_offset_m"	0				Propagation Distance (in air) between ref signals and IGM
    "central_IGM_wavelength_approx_nm":		1600,				The approximate central WL of your spectroscopy light	

    "IGMs_spectrum_min_freq_Hz": 		17000000.0,			lower frequency limit for filter on IGM
    "IGMs_spectrum_max_freq_Hz": 		93000000.0,			higher frequency limit for filter on IGM
    "bandwidth_filter_fopt": 			5000000.0,			BW for fopt beatnotes filters (central position computed in pre-acquitition)
    "bandwidth_filter_ceo": 			8000000.0,			BW for CEO beatnotes filters (central position computed in pre-acquitition)

    "nb_pts_per_channel_compute": 		15000000.0,			how many point are used by Matlab compiled script from pre-acq to compute correction parameters
    "nb_pts_post_processing": 			200000000.0,			in post-processing, how many points will be processed (total pts, not pts ber buffer)

    "half_width_template": 			-1,				-1, or forced value for the half witdh of the template used for xcorr

    "signals_channel_index": 			[				On which acq card channel various signals should be taken 				
       						1,				IGM
        					2,				fop1		here both fopt are multiplexed on the same card input
        					2,				fop2
        					3,				fceo1		we do not care which is 1 or 2, both for CEO and optical beats
        					4				fceo2
    						],

    "decimation_factor": 			2,				Data is decimated by this factor after fast phase correction (1 or 2 for now)
    "save_to_float": 				1,				1 : float32  0: int16,  format for saved data

    "max_delay_xcorr": 				40,				Nb of points scanned by xcorr when searching next IGM
    "nb_pts_interval_interpolation": 		20,				Nb of points scaned when searching where falls wanted point on actual grid. 

"nb_coefficients_filters":			32,				Nb of points used for the fir filters (32, 64 or 96). Increasing the number of points will increase the filter performance at the cost of increased computation time.


										All the following are for internal use only, not intended for the user,
										These parameters are mostly used to pass information from the C code to the 										matlab compiled script
										They are thus written over by the C script, regardless of what is specified 										in the interface
    "do_post_processing": 			0,				0 means we are in real-time acq mode, 1 means we are post-processing previously acquired raw data
    "date_path": 				"20240207_16h12m07s",		In the base path, each acquistion is saved in a dated folder									
    "input_data_file_name": 			"DataName.bin",
