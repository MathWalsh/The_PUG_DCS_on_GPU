The file gageCard_params.json in the "parameters" folder of the python interface code is loaded automatically when the interface is started.
You can edit and save it using the 'GaGe Parameters' panel in the python interface. 

Normally, changing these paramaters should seldomly be needed, once a specific card is setup.

This json replaces the .ini file used in gage coding examples. In fact, the C application  will write a proper GaGe ini file from this json

All json parameter files are saved with acquisition data in /BasePath/datePath/fileName (see A Priori parameters)

This file describes the meaning of each parameter expected in this "gageCard_params.json" file
as well as the default values used as of March 2024, with a CSE161G4-LR card
check you card manual for allowed values 

The lower you go in the list, the more you should question if you should really modify this parameter


	"nb_pts_per_buffer":	40e6			Total number of points per buffer returned by gage card here, with 4 channels, we have10e6 pts per channel (min 20e6 max 60e6)
							This is what sets the number of igm per buffer, should be set to have at least 10 IGMs per buffer
	"segment_size":		40e6			Nb of wanted points per channel (pre-acq and RAW data acquisition, automatically set to -1 for real-time processing) MAX 2e9
							Here we would, in pre or RAW acquistion, receive 4 buffers of 10e6 pts per channel
							In real-time processing, infinite (-1) buffers of 10e6 pts per channel

	"nb_channels":		4,			Number of channels used for this acquisition
	"sampling_rate_Hz":	200e6,			Sampling rate for this acqustion

	"external_clock":	0,			Is the data sampled using an internal (0) or external (1) clock (not yet implemented)
	"channel1_range_mV":	480,			Input range, for channel 1
	"channel1_coupling":	"DC",			DC ou AC coupling, channel 1
	"channel1_impedance":	50,			Input impedance, channel 1
	"channel2_range_mV":	480,
	"channel2_coupling":	"DC",
	"channel2_impedance":	50,
	"channel3_range_mV":	480,
	"channel3_coupling":	"DC",
	"channel3_impedance":	50,
	"channel4_range_mV":	480,
	"channel4_coupling":	"DC",
	"channel4_impedance":	50,
	"trigger_level":	0,			Trigger level, that would mean 0 V
	"trigger_source":	1,			Trigger source, here on channel 1  should we put none ? 
	"nb_bytes_per_sample":	2,			16 bits (2 bytes) are sent for each measured sample. 
	"ref_clock_10MHz": 0				10 MHz reference clock, gage card locks to it with its PLL
